Software platform for creating tests and e-books

Providing distance learning opportunities, periodic evaluation, classification and certification of knowledge and skills of students, academics and professionals.

Construction of test items in the test form (open, closed, to meet, to ordering) using OLE-technology and multi-media components. Tests are presented in the form of groups or didactic units.

Create full featured e-books: the introduction of a system of manual testing and evaluation of knowledge, the ability to create stand-alone books in the form of executable files, the use of technology phased study material.

Development environment consists of three main software components:

Test editor, and e-books;
Test server that provides automated testing process, both in a local network or the Internet;
Test Module - client module for automated testing.
The software module "Test Server" does not require the installation of additional software on the computer, but it can carry out the storage of information on the results of SQL database server. Testing on a local network or the Internet may exercise immediately after you install and activate it.

Directory users (required for identification in the process of testing);
View module test results.
The module allows you to view the test results to analyze the data according to several criteria, including the ability to carry out not only testing, but also questioning.

Diagrams:
1. calculating the density distribution of scores,
2. calculating the coefficients of solvability of tasks and duration of the jobs in
rate of development of didactic units;
3. development of the discipline.
4. statistical analysis of the results of testing by the Birnbaum's method.
